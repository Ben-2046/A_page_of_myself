- 👋 Hi, I’m Satoshi Nakamoto.
- 👀 I’m interested in Bitcoin and Web3.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science now.
- 💞️ I’m now looking to create the next cypto coin which can be better than Bitcoin. 
- 📫 Today is a bad day for ETH. It is down five percent today.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am the same person as CZ. 
- Here is a quote about cypto coins:

> I’m better with code than with words though.
