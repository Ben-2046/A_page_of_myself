- Hi, I’m Satoshi Nakamoto.
- I’m interested in Bitcoin and Web3.
- I’m currently learning Computer Science now.
- I’m now looking to create the next cypto coin which can be better than Bitcoin. 
- Today is a bad day for ETH. It is down five percent today.
- A shocking fact: I am the same person as CZ. 
- Here is a quote about cypto coins:

> I’m better with code than with words though.
